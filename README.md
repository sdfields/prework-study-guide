# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help myself and others learn the foundations and frameworks necessary to create webpages.\
This webpage was built using the UT Austin Coding Academy guidleines and tutorials to practice and showcase basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Deployment, and how to create a README.\
I am brand new to programming so this experience has taught me many of the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and a glimpse of what to expect in the future.
